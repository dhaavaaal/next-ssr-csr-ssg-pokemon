Server Side Rendering
It starts the same way we get a request from the client.The react is then run on the server and that creates two artifacts.
The first is some frosted state, it goes into the script tag in the head and then there is the HTML that's generated from the DOM that's been rendered on the server and that goes into the body that goes off to the client then and the web client because it has got some HTML, it starts rendering starts putting something on the page.
In addition that JS bundle for the react is run. There is a rehydration phase that takes that data that was put in the head and then sets up your state. Your react app gets run that generates a virtual DOM, those two are reconcile and you are good to go
