Which One To Choose When?

So for CSR it would be good for log in experiences as you're never gonna render a bank account kindof page without authorisation or without understanding who the customer is.
It's also great for SPA's
It's really the only way to do SPA's
It's great for proof oof concepts and where performance is not necessarily all that critical 

One could choose SSR if had requirements like SEO support or pages on loading fast on slow connections 

And one should prefer SSG if I has those heavy requirements and also a fairly slow moving page set like for example the product list from a e-commerce site.
